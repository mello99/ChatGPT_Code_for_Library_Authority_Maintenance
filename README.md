# ChatGPT_Code_for_Library_Authority_Maintenance

This series of Python and Windows Batch files were created with ChatGPT and refactored with CodexGPT to automatically download, convert, and join authority file updates from the Library of Congress's daily LCSH and LCNAF activity feeds for import into (or deletion from) integrated library systems. 

Feel free to comment - code recommendations are always welcome!
